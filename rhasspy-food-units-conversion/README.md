# Food Units conversion

I like to do most of my cooking by weight.  I find the outcomes to be more consistent, I have fewer utensils to clean (e.g. measuring cups), and it's easier to get the measurements right when I'm distracted (whicn is often when I'm cooking).

However, many of my old recipies still use the old volumetric units.  This module is used to convert volume measurements to grams for many of the common ingredients I use.

## Dependencies
- bc (For floating point math in bash)
- num2words (for better number pronounciation the the built-in stuff)
